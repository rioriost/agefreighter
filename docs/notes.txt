## Design Considerations
    - Multi threading support
        - All the classes support context manager
    - Multi processing support
    - Dynamic importing of dependencies for small distributions
    - Common interface for different data sources
    - Interfaces and common exporter and importer design
        - Interface(Inheritance of AgeExporter, neo4j etc): convert data source to common data representation
            - Exporter(AgeExporter): convert common data representation to CSV compatible with COPY command
        - Importer(AgeFreighter): load CSV using COPY protocol
    - Support for multiple platforms, macOS, Linux, Windows

## Current restrictions with Apache AGE 1.5
    - No support for multiple labels on a single node
    - No support for tab characters in properties
