# AGEFreighter

a Python package that helps you to create a graph database using Azure Database for PostgreSQL.

[Apache AGEâ„¢](https://age.apache.org/) is a PostgreSQL Graph database compatible with PostgreSQL's distributed assets and leverages graph data structures to analyze and use relationships and patterns in data.

[Azure Database for PostgreSQL](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/postgresql/) is a managed database service that is based on the open-source Postgres database engine.

[Introducing support for Graph data in Azure Database for PostgreSQL (Preview)](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/blog/adforpostgresql/introducing-support-for-graph-data-in-azure-database-for-postgresql-preview/4275628).

## 0.5.0 Release
Refactored the code to make it more readable and maintainable with the separated classes for factory model.
Please note how to use the new version of the package is tottally different from the previous versions.

### 0.5.2 Release -AzureStorageFreighter-
* AzureStorageFreighter class is used to load data from Azure Storage into the graph database. It's totally different from other classes. The class works as follows:
  * If the argument, 'subscription_id' is not set, the class tries to find the Azure Subscription ID from your local environment using the 'az' command.
  * Creates an Azure Storage account and a blob container under the resource group where the PostgreSQL server runs in.
  * Enables the 'azure_storage' extension in the PostgreSQL server, if it's not enabled.
  * Uploads the CSV file to the blob container.
  * Creates a UDF (User Defined Function) named 'load_from_azure_storage' in the PostgreSQL server. The UDF loads data from the Azure Storage into the graph database.
  * Executes the UDF.
* The above process takes time to prepare for loading data, making it unsuitable for loading small files, but effective for loading large files. For instance, it takes under 3 seconds to load 'actorfilms.csv' after uploading.
* However, please note that it is still in the early stages of implementation, so there is room for optimization and potential issues due to insufficient testing.

### 0.5.3 Release -AzureStorageFreighter-
* AzureStorageFreighter class is totally refactored for better performance and scalability.
  * 0.5.2 didn't work well for large files.
  * Now, it works well for large files.
    Checked with a 5.4GB CSV file consisting of 10M of start vertices, 10K of end vertices, and 25M edges,
    it took 512 seconds to load the data into the graph database with PostgreSQL Flex,
    Standard_D32ds_v4 (32 vcpus, 128 GiB memory) and 512TB / 7500 iops of storage.
  * Tested data was generated with tests/generate_dummy_data.py.
  * UDF to load the data to graph is no longer used.
* However, please note that it is still in the early stages of implementation, so there is room for optimization and potential issues due to insufficient testing.

### 0.6.0 Release
* Added edge properties support.
  * 'edge_props' argument (list) is added to the 'load()' method.
* 'drop_graph' argument is obsoleted. 'create_graph' argument is added.
  * 'create_graph' is set to True by default. CAUTION: If the graph already exists, the graph is dropped before loading the data.
  * If 'create_graph' is False, the data is loaded into the existing graph.

### Features
* Asynchronous connection pool support for psycopg PostgreSQL driver
* 'direct_loading' option for loading data directly into the graph. If 'direct_loading' is True, the data is loaded into the graph using the 'INSERT' statement, not Cypher queries.
* 'COPY' protocol support for loading data into the graph. If 'use_copy' is True, the data is loaded into the graph using the 'COPY' protocol.

### File Format for AzureStorageFreighter
AzureStorageFreighter class loads data from Azure Storage. It has two methods to load data from Azure Storage, 'load' and 'load_multi'. The 'load' method loads data from a single CSV file, and the 'load_multi' method loads data from multiple CSV files.
  * 'load' expects the exactly same format as CSVFreighter.
  * 'load_multi' expects the exactly same format as MultiCSVFreighter.

See, [tests/agefreightertester.py](https://github.com/rioriost/agefreighter/blob/main/tests/agefreightertester.py) and [docs](https://github.com/rioriost/agefreighter/blob/main/docs/) for more details.

### Test & Samples
```sql
export PG_CONNECTION_STRING="host=your_host.postgres.database.azure.com port=5432 dbname=postgres user=account password=your_password"
